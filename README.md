liblightning
===========

liblightning is a C library for playing audio samples with JACK on Linux systems.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lightning/liblightning.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lightning/liblightning)

It is a very young project, but can already

* play back audio samples read from disk
* control pitch and gain for each triggered sample
* export its output to an audio file

Ideas for the near future are:

* support opus file format for playback and export
* expose a sequencer API
